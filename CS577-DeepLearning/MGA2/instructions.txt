In this assignment, our goal is to use PyTorch to implement 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sentiment analysis task. 

Sentiment analysis is to classify sentences (input) into certain 
sentiments (output labels), which includes positive, negative 
and neutral.

We will use a benckmark dataset, SST, for this assignment.

we download the SST dataset from torchtext package, and do some 
preprocessing to build vocabulary and split the dataset into 
training/validation/test sets. You don't need to modify the code 
in this step.
